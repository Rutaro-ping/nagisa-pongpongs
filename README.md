Hi! 
I am a blockchain and web developer with over 5 years of hands-on experience designing, building, and deploying scalable solutions. 
Currently, I collaborate with a team of 7 colleagues at a technology company based in Manila, where I contribute to end-to-end development processesâ€”from smart contract implementation and decentralized application (dApp) architecture to full-stack web development. 
My expertise spans blockchain protocols, smart contract optimization, and secure transaction workflows, as well as modern web technologies for front-end and back-end systems. 
I am passionate about delivering innovative, reliable, and high-performance applications that bridge the gap between blockchain and traditional web ecosystems.
